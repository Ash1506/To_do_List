# To_do_List
I've made a project called To-do List which is used to maintain our daily task. In this, we can:
1. Create a new task
2. Edit the particular task
3. Delete the particular task

This project have been made by using tools like React.js, CSS and some additional packages like bootstrap, font-awesome icons for icon styling.
